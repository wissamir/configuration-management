# in YAML think about this as
# a labled list/array which is a list item itself
#... in parsing notion
# it is a dictionary in which the label is a key
# and the list is the value.. as seen below
# and since it is an item of a bigger list
# the whole parsing is put inside an array [] 
#>>> fd = open('listed-labeled-list.yml', 'r')
#>>> yaml.load(fd)
#[{'Fruits': ['Orange', 'Apple', 'Banana']}]
- Fruits:
  - Orange
  - Apple
  - Banana
