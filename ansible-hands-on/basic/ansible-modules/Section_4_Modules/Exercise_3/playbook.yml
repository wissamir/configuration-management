# Update the playbook to add a new task in the beginning to add an entry into /etc/resolv.conf file for hosts. The line to be added is 'nameserver 10.1.250.10'
# Note the new task must be executed first, so place it accordingly.
# lineinfile documentation
#Examples
#
## Before 2.3, option 'dest', 'destfile' or 'name' was used instead of 'path'
#- lineinfile:
#    path: /etc/selinux/config
#    regexp: '^SELINUX='
#    line: 'SELINUX=enforcing'
# 
#- lineinfile:
#    path: /etc/sudoers
#    state: absent
#    regexp: '^%wheel'
